# Hey, I'm Radoslav 👋🏻

#### ***Self-taught in Python for trading** — from zero to backtests, Monte Carlo simulations, and probability-driven strategies.*

🚀 What I'm currently up to:
* Designing and backtesting crypto & futures strategies (BTC, ETH, ES, NQ) using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Cursor**
* Building **Monte Carlo simulations** to stress-test edge, drawdowns, and statistical robustness
* Translating **EV, Bayes, LLN, CLT, and Confidence Intervals** into live trading logic
* Using **DataBento** for quality market data

💻 Skills:
* **Python** – Strategy logic, vectorized operations, simulation
* **Pandas** – Data cleaning, time-series analysis, performance metrics
* **NumPy** – Statistical modeling, random walks, covariance
* **Matplotlib** – Equity curves, distribution plots, volatility analysis
* **Cursor** – Rapid strategy prototyping and backtesting
* HTML/CSS

📚 Background:
* **6+ years manual trading** – US Futures (ES/NQ), Crypto (BTC/ETH), CFDs
* Discretionary P&L tracking with statistical post-mortems (risk/reward, regime shifts)
* Former Sales / BD in Fintech – speaks fluent markets and execution
